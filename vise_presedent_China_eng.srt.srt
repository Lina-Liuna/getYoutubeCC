Thank You Ken for that kind introduction
to members of the Board of Trustees to

dr. Michael Pillsbury to our
distinguished guests and all of you who

true to your mission in this place think
about the future in unconventional ways

it is an honor to be back at the Hudson
Institute for more than a half a century

this institute is dedicated itself to
advancing global security prosperity and

freedom and while Hudson's hometowns
have changed over the years one thing

has been constant you've always advanced
that vital truth that American

leadership lights the way and today
speaking of leadership allow me to begin

by bringing greetings from a great
champion of American leadership at home

and abroad I bring greetings from the

America president Donald Trump from
early in this administration President

Trump has made our relationship with
China and President Xi a priority on

April 6 of last year President Trump
welcomed President Xi to Mara Lago on
November 8th of last year President

Trump traveled to Beijing where China's
leader welcomed him warmly over the

course of the past two years our
president has forged a strong personal

relationship with the president of the
People's Republic of China and they've
worked closely on issues of common

interest most importantly the
denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula

but I come before you today because the
American people deserve to know that as
we speak Beijing is employing a

whole-of-government approach using
political economic and military tools as

well as propaganda to advance its
influence and benefit its interest in

the United States
China is also applying this power in

more proactive ways than ever before to
exert influence and interfere in the

domestic policy and politics of this
country under president Trump's

leadership the United States has taken
decisive action to respond to China with

American action applying the principles
and the policies long advocated in these

halls in our national security strategy
that the president released last

December he described a new era of great
power competition foreign nations have

begun to as we wrote reassert their
influence regionally and globally and

they're contesting America's
geopolitical advantages and trying in

essence to change the international
order in their favor in this strategy

President Trump made clear that the
United States of America has adopted a

new approach to China we seek a
relationship grounded in fairness

reciprocity and respect for sovereignty
and we have taken strong and swift

action to achieve that goal as the
president said last year on his visit to

China in his words we have an
opportunity to strengthen the

relationship between our two countries
and improve the lives of our citizens

our vision of the future is built on the
best parts of our past when America and

China reached out to one another in a
spirit of openness and friendship when

our young nation went searching in the
wake of the Revolutionary War for new

markets for our exports the Chinese
people welcomed American traders laden

with ginseng and fur when China suffered
through indignities and exploitations

during her so-called century of
humiliation

America refused to join in and advocated
the open door policy so that we could

have freer trade with China and preserve
their sovereignty when American
missionaries brought the good news to

China's shores they were moved by the
rich culture of an ancient and vibrant

people and not only did they spread
their faith

those same missionaries founded some of
China's first and finest universities
when the Second World War arose we stood

together as allies in the fight against
imperialism and in that Wars aftermath

America ensured that China became a
charter member of the United Nations and

a great shaper of the post-war world but
soon after it took power in 1949 the

Chinese Communist Party began to pursue
authoritarian expansionism it is

remarkable to think that only five years
after our nation's had fought together

we fought each other in the mountains
and valleys of the Korean Peninsula

my own father saw combat on that
frontier of freedom but not even the

brutal Korean War could diminish our
mutual desire to restore the ties that

for so long had found our peoples
together

China's estrangement from the United
States ended in 1972 and soon after we

re-established diplomatic relations it
began to open our economies to one
another and American universities began

training a new generation of Chinese
engineers business leaders scholars and

officials after the fall of the Soviet
Union we assumed that a free China was

inevitable Hedy with optimism at the
turn of the 21st century America agreed

to give Beijing open access to our
economy and we brought China into the

World Trade Organization previous
administrations made this choice in the

hope that freedom in China would expand
in all of its forms not just
economically but politically with a

newfound respect for classical liberal
principles private property personal

liberty religious freedom the entire
family of human rights but that Hope has

gone unfulfilled the dream of freedom
remains distant for the Chinese people

and while Beijing still pays lip service
to reform and opening

Dunc shoppings famous policy now rings
hollow over the past 17 years China's

GDP has grown nine fold it's become the
second largest economy in the world much

of this success was driven by American
investment in China and the Chinese

Communist Party has also used an arsenal
of policies inconsistent with free and

fair trade including tariffs quotas
currency manipulation forced technology

transfer intellectual property theft and
industrial subsidies that are handed out

like candy to foreign investment these
policies have built Beijing's

manufacturing base at the expense of its
competitors especially the United States
of America China's actions have

contributed to a trade deficit with the
United States that last year ran to 375

billion dollars nearly half of our
global trade deficit as president Trump

said just this week in his words we
rebuilt China over the last 25 years now

through the made in China 2025 plan the
Communist Party has set its sights on

controlling 90% of the world's most
advanced industries including robotics

biotechnology and artificial
intelligence to win the commanding

heights of the 21st century economy
Beijing has directed its bureaucrats and

businesses to obtain American
intellectual property the foundation of

our economic leadership by any means
necessary

Beijing now requires many American
businesses to hand over their trade
secrets as the cost of doing business in

China it also coordinates and sponsors
the acquisition of American firms to

gain ownership of their creations worst
of all Chinese security agencies have
masterminded the wholesale theft of a

mayor
and technology including cutting-edge

military blueprints and using that
stolen technology the Chinese Communist

Party is turning plowshares into swords
on a massive scale China now spends as

much on its military as the rest of Asia
combined and Beijing has prioritized

capabilities to erode America's military
advantages on land at sea in the air and

in space China wants nothing less than
to push the United States of America

from the western Pacific and attempt to
prevent us from coming to the aid of our
allies but they will fail Beijing is

also using its power like never before
Chinese ships routinely patrol around

the Senkaku Islands which are
administered by Japan and while China's
leaders stood in the Rose Garden at the

White House in 2015 and said that his
country had and I quote no intention to

militarize the South China Sea today
Beijing has deployed advanced anti-ship

and anti-air missiles atop an
archipelago of military bases

constructed on artificial islands
China's aggression was on display this

week when a Chinese naval vessel came
within 45 yards of the USS Decatur as it

conducted freedom of navigation
operations in the South China Sea

forcing our ship to quickly maneuver to
avoid collision
despite such reckless harassment the

United States Navy will continue to fly
sail and operate wherever international

law allows and our national interest
demand we will not be intimidated and we

will not stand down

[Applause]

America had hoped that economic
liberalisation would bring China into a

greater partnership with us and with the
world instead China has chosen economic

aggression which has in turn emboldened
its growing military nowhere as we had
hoped as Beijing move toward greater

freedom for its own people for a time
Beijing inched toward greater liberty

and respect for human rights but in
recent years China has taken a sharp U

turn toward control and oppression of
its own people today China has built an

unparalleled surveillance state and it's
growing more expansive and intrusive

often with the help of us technology
what they call the Great Firewall of

China likewise grows higher drastically
restricting the free flow of information
to the Chinese people and by 2020

China's rulers aim to implement an
Orwellian system premise on controlling

virtually every facet of human life the
so called social credit score in the

words of that program's official
blueprint it will allow the trustworthy
to roam everywhere under heaven while

making it hard for the discredited to
take a single step and when it comes to

religious freedom a new wave of
persecution is crashing down on Chinese
Christians Buddhists and Muslims last

month
Beijing shut down one of China's largest

underground churches across the country
authorities are tearing down crosses

burning Bibles and imprisoning believers
and Beijing is now reached a deal with

the Vatican that gives the avowedly
atheist calm

is party a direct role in appointing
Catholic Bishops for China's Christians

these are desperate times Beijing is
also cracking down on Buddhism over the

past decade more than 150 Tibetan
Buddhist monks have lit themselves on
fire to protest China's repression of

their beliefs and their culture and in
Jing Jiang the Communist Party has

imprisoned as many as 1 million Muslim
Uighur in government camps where they

endure round-the-clock brainwashing
survivors of the camps have described

their experience as a deliberate attempt
by Beijing to strangle Weger culture and
stamp out the Muslim faith as history

attests though a country that oppresses
its own people rarely stops there and

Beijing also aims to extend its reach
across the wider world as Hudson's own

dr. Michael Pillsbury has written China
has opposed the actions and goals of the

United States government indeed China is
building its own relationships with

America's allies and enemies that
contradict any peaceful or productive

intentions of Beijing in fact China uses
so-called debt diplomacy to expand its

influence today that country is offering
hundreds of billions of dollars in

infrastructure loans to governments from
Asia to Africa to Europe and even Latin

America yet the terms of those loans are
opaque at best and the benefits

invariably flow overwhelmingly to
Beijing just as Sri Lanka which took on

a massive debt to let Chinese state
companies build a port of questionable
commercial value two years ago that

country could no longer afford its
so Beijing pressured Sri Lanka to

deliver the new port directly into
Chinese hands it may soon become a

forward military base for China's
growing blue water Navy within our own

hemisphere Beijing has extended a
lifeline to the corrupt and incompetent

Maduro regime in Venezuela that's been
oppressing its own people they pledged

five billion dollars in questionable
loans to be repaid with oil China is

also that country's single largest
creditor saddling the Venezuelan people

with more than 50 billion dollars in
debt even as their democracy vanishes

Beijing is also impacting some nation's
politics by providing direct support to

parties and candidates who promise to
accommodate China's strategic objectives

since last year alone Chinese Communist
Party has convinced three Latin American

nations to sever ties with Taipei and
recognize Beijing these actions threaten

the stability of the Taiwan Strait and
the United States of America condemns

these actions and while our
administration will continue to respect
our one China policy as reflected in the

three joint communique Xand the Taiwan
Relations Act America will always

believe that Taiwan's embrace of
democracy shows a better path for all

the Chinese people

[Applause]
now these are only a few of the ways the

China has sought to advance its
strategic interests across the world

with growing intensity and
sophistication yet previous

administrations all but ignored China's
actions and in many cases they abetted

them but those days are over under
president Trump's leadership the United

States of America has been defending our
interests with renewed American strength

we've been making the strongest military
in the history of the world stronger

still earlier this year President Trump
signed into law the largest increase in
our national defense since the days of

Ronald Reagan 716 billion dollars to
extend the strength of the American

military to every domain we're
modernizing our nuclear arsenal we're

fielding and developing new cutting-edge
fighters and bombers we're building a

new generation of aircraft carriers and
warships we're investing as never before

in our armed forces and this includes
initiating the process to establish the

United States space force to ensure our
continued dominance in space and we've

taken action to authorize increased
capability in the cyber world to build

deterrence against our adversaries at
president Trump's direction we're also

implementing tariffs on two hundred and
fifty billion dollars in Chinese goods

with the highest terrorists specifically
targeting the advanced industries that

Beijing is trying to capture and control
and as the president has also made clear

we will levy even more tariffs with the
possibility of substantially more than

doubling that number unless a fair and
reciprocal trade deal is made

[Applause]
these actions exercises in American

strength have had a major impact China's
largest stock exchange fell by 25% in

the first nine months of this year in
large part because our administration

has been standing strong against
Beijing's trade practices as president

Trump has made clear we don't want
China's markets to suffer in fact we

want them to thrive but the United
States wants Beijing to pursue trade

policies that are free fair and
reciprocal and we will continue to stand

and demand that they do

[Applause]
sadly China's rulers thus far have

refused to take that path the American
people deserve to know in response to

the strong stand the President Trump has
taken Beijing is pursuing a

comprehensive and coordinated campaign
to undermine support for the president

our agenda and our nation's most
cherished ideals I want to tell you

today what we know about China's actions
here at home some of which we've gleaned
from intelligence assessments some of

which are publicly available but all of
which are fact as I said before as we

speak Beijing is employing a
whole-of-government approach to advance
its influence and benefit its interests

its employing this power in more
proactive and coercive ways to interfere

in the domestic policies of this country
and to interfere in the politics of the

United States the Chinese Communist
Party is rewarding or coercing American

businesses movie studios universities
think tanks scholars journalists and

local state and federal officials
and worst of all China has initiated an

unprecedented effort to influence
American public opinion the 2018

elections and the environment leading
into the 2020 presidential elections to

put it bluntly president Trump's
leadership is working and China wants a

different American president there can
be no doubt China is meddling in

America's democracy as president Trump
said just last week we have in his words

found that China has been attempting to
interfere in our upcoming midterm

elections our intelligence community
says that China is targeting US state

and local governments and officials to
exploit any divisions between federal

and local levels on policy it's using
wedge issues like trade tariffs to

advance Beijing's
political influence in June Beijing

itself circulated a sensitive document
entitled propaganda and censorship

notice it laid out its strategy it
stated that China must in their words

quote strike accurately and carefully
splitting apart different domestic
groups in the United States of America

to that end Beijing is mobilized covert
actors front groups and propaganda

outlets to shift Americans perception of
Chinese policy as a senior career member

of our intelligence community told me
just this week what the Russians are

doing pales in comparison to what China
is doing across this country and the

American people deserve to know it

senior Chinese officials have also tried
to influence business leaders to

encourage them to condemn our trade
actions leveraging their desire to

maintain their operations in China in
one recent example China threatened to

deny a business license for a major u.s.
corporation if they refuse to speak out

against our administration's policies
and when it comes to influencing the

midterms you need only look at Beijing's
tariffs in response to ours the tariffs

imposed by China to date specifically
targeted industries and states that

would play an important role in the 2018
elections by one estimate more than 80

percent of US counties targeted by China
voted for president Trump and I in 2016

now China wants to turn these voters
against our administration and China is

also directly appealing to American
voters last week the Chinese government

paid to have a multi-page supplement
inserted into the Des Moines Register

the paper of record of the home state of
our ambassador to China in a pivotal

state in 2018 and 2020 the supplement
designed to look like the news articles

cast our trade policies as reckless and
harmful Islands fortunately Americans

aren't buying it for example American
farmers are standing with this president

and seeing real results from the strong
stance that he's taken including this

week's US Mexico Canada Agreement where
we've substantially opened North

American markets to US products the US
MCA is a great win for American farmers

and American manufacturers
[Applause]

but China's actions aren't focused
solely on influencing our policies and

politics Beijing is also taking steps to
exploit its economic leverage and the

allure of their large marketplace to
advance its influence over American

businesses Beijing now requires American
joint ventures that operate in China to

establish what they call party
organizations within their company

giving the Communist Party a voice and
perhaps a veto in hiring and investment

decisions Chinese authorities have also
threatened US companies that depict

Taiwan as a distinct geographic entity
or that stray from Chinese policy on

Tibet Beijing compelled Delta Airlines
to publicly apologize for not calling

Taiwan a province of China on its
website and it pressured Marriott to

fire a US employee who merely liked a
tweet about Tibet and Beijing routinely

demands that Hollywood portray China in
a strictly positive light it punishes

Studios and producers that don't Beijing
censors are quick to edit or outlaw

movies that criticize China even in
minor ways in them for the movie World

War Z they had to cut the scripts
mention of a virus because it originated

in China the movie Red Dawn was
digitally edited to make the villains

North Korean not Chinese

but beyond business and entertainment
the Chinese Communist Party is also
spending billions of dollars on

propaganda outlets in the United States
and frankly around the world China Radio

International now broadcasts Beijing
friendly programs on over 30 US outlets

many and major Americans
the China Global Television network

reaches more than 75 million Americans
and it it gets its marching orders

directly from its communist party
masters as China's top leader put it

during a visit to the network's
headquarters and I quote the media run

by the party and the government our
propaganda fronts and must have the

party as their surname it's for those
reasons and that reality that last month

the Department of Justice ordered that
network to register as a foreign agent

the Communist Party has also threatened
and detained the Chinese family members

of American journalists who pride too
deep and it's blocked the websites of US

media organizations and made it harder
for our journalists to get visas this
happened after the New York Times

published investigative reports about
the wealth of some of China's leaders

but the media isn't the only place where
Chinese Communist Party seeks to foster

a culture of censorship the same is true
across academia

I mean look no further than the Chinese
students and scholars Association of
which there are more than 150 branches

across America's campuses these groups
help organize social events for some of

the more than 430,000 Chinese nationals
studying in the United States they also

alert Chinese consulates and embassies
when Chinese students and American

schools stray from the Communist Party
line at the University of Maryland a

Chinese student recently spoke at her
graduation of what she called and I

quote the fresh air of free speech in
America the Communist Party's official
newspaper swiftly chastised her

she became the victim of a firestorm of
criticism on China's tightly controlled

social media and her family back home
was harassed as for the university

itself its exchange program with China
one of the nation's most extensive

suddenly turned from a flood to a
trickle

China exerts academic pressure in other
ways as well
Beijing provides generous funding to

universities think tanks and scholars
with the understanding that they will

avoid ideas that the communist party
finds dangerous or offensive China

experts in particular know that their
visas will be delayed or denied if their

research contradicts Beijing's talking
points and even scholars and groups who

avoid Chinese funding are targeted by
that country as the Hudson Institute
found out firsthand after you offered to

host a speaker Beijing didn't like your
website suffered a major cyber attack
originating from Shanghai the Hudson

Institute knows better than most that
the Chinese Communist Party is trying to

undermine academic freedom and the
freedom of speech in America today these

and other actions taken as a whole
constitute an intensifying effort to
shift American public opinion and policy

away from the American first leadership
of President Donald Trump but our

message to China's rulers is this this
president will not back down

[Applause]
the American people will not be swayed

and we will continue to stand strong for
our security and our economy even as we

hope for improved relations with Beijing

our administration is going to continue
to act decisively to protect America's

interests American jobs and American
security as we rebuild our military we

will continue to assert American
interests across the indo-pacific as we

respond to China's trade practices we
will continue to demand an economic

relationship with China that is free
fair and reciprocal we will demand the

Beijing breakdown as trade barriers
fulfill its obligations fully open its

economy just as we have opened ours
we'll continue to take action against

Beijing until the theft of American
intellectual property ends once and for

all and we will continue to stand strong
until Beijing stops the predatory

practice of forced technology transfer
we will protect the private property

interests of American enterprise

and to advance our vision of a free and
open indo-pacific we're building new and

stronger bonds with nations that share
our values across the region from India

to Samoa our relationships will flow
from a spirit of respect built on

partnership not domination
we're forging new trade deals on a
bilateral basis just as last week

President Trump signed an improved trade
deal with South Korea and we will soon

begin historic negotiations for a
bilateral free trade agreement with

Japan I'm also pleased to report that
we're streamlining international

development and finance programs will be
giving foreign nations adjust and

transparent alternative to China's debt
trap diplomacy in fact this week

President Trump will sign the build Act
into law next month it'll be my

privilege to represent the United States
in Singapore and Papua New Guinea at

ASEAN and APEC there we will unveil new
measures and programs to support a free

and open Indo Pacific and on behalf of
the president I will deliver the message

that America's commitment to the Indo
Pacific has never been stronger

[Applause]
closer to home to protect our interests

we recently strengthened Sophia's the
Committee on foreign investment

heightening our scrutiny of Chinese
investment in America to protect our

national security from Beijing's
predatory actions when it comes to

Beijing's malign influence and
interference in American politics and

policy we will continue to expose it
no matter the form it takes we will work

with leaders at every level of society
to defend our national interests and our

most cherished ideals the American
people will play the decisive role in

fact they already are
as we gather here a new consensus on
China is rising across America more

business leaders are thinking beyond the
next quarter and thinking twice before

diving in to the Chinese market if it
means turning over their intellectual

property or abetting Beijing's
oppression but more must follow suit for

example Google should immediately end
development of the Dragonfly app that

will strengthen the Communist Party's
censorship and compromise the privacy of

Chinese customers
[Applause]

it's also great to see more journalists
reporting the truth without fear or

favor digging deep to find where China
is interfering in our society and why

and we hope that American and global
news organizations will continue to join
this effort on an increasing basis more

scholars are also speaking out
forcefully and defending academic

freedom and more universities and think
tanks are mustering the courage to turn

away Beijing's easy money recognizing
that every dollar comes with a

corresponding demand and we're confident
that their ranks will grow and across

the nation the American people are
growing in vigilance with a newfound

appreciation for our administration's
actions and the president's leadership

to reset America's economic and
strategic relationship with China

Americans stand strong behind a
president that's putting America first

and under president Trump's leadership I
can assure you America will stay the

course China should know that the
American people and their elected
officials in both parties are resolved

as our national security strategy States

we should remember that competition does
not always mean hostility nor does it

have to

the president's made clear we want a
constructive relationship with Beijing

where our prosperity and security grow
together not apart while Beijing has

been moving further away from this
vision China's rulers can still change
course and return to the spirit of

reform and opening that characterize the
beginning of this relationship decades

ago the American people want nothing
more and the Chinese people deserve
nothing less the great Chinese

storyteller Lu Shuang often lamented
that his country and he wrote has either

looked down at foreigners as brutes or
up to them as Saints but never as equals

today America is reaching out our hand
to China and we hope that soon Beijing
will reach back with deeds not words and

with renewed respect for America but be
assured we will not relent until our

relationship with China is grounded in
fairness reciprocity and respect for our

sovereignty

[Applause]

there's an ancient Chinese proverb that
that reads men see only the present but

heaven sees the future as we go forward
let us pursue a future of peace and
prosperity with resolve and faith faith

in president Trump's leadership and
vision and the relationship that he has

forged with China's president faith in
the enduring friendship between the

American people and the Chinese people
and faiths that haven't seized the

future and by God's grace America and
China will meet that future together

thank you god bless you and God bless
the United States

[Applause]

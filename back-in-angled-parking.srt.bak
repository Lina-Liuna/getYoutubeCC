back-in angled parking is coming to our city streets in the exchange district.
changing on-street parallel parking to back-in angle stalls will increase the number of parking spaces available in busy areas of the city. this type of parking is safer for drivers and passengers when getting into and out of a vehicle. it's a new concept for winnipeg drivers, but parking in back-inangle stalls is as easy as one-two-three.

one - find an open stall and signal to let others know you intend to park.

two - drive past the stall and stop.

three - reverse into the space using your side mirrors to view the lines.

now you're safely parked. when you're ready to leaveit's easy to see on

coming vehicletraffic, cyclists and pedestrians.

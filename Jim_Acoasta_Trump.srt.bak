The white house pulled credentials from jim acosta after this ridiculous performance at the white house saturday.
i want to challenge you on one of the things you said in the campaign of the mid terms.
that this caravan was aninvasion.

president trump: i consider it to be an invasion. 

it's not an invasion, it's agroup of migrants moving up fromcentral america toward theborder with the u.s.why did you characterize it as such.

president trump: because i consider it an invasion.you and i have a difference of opinion.

&gt;&gt; do you think you demonizedimmigrants?

president trump: no, i want themto come into the country, butthey have to get in legally.we need the people and i wantthem to come in.you know why we need the people.we have hundreds of companiesmoving in, we need the people.

&gt;&gt; your campaign had an adshowing migrants climbing oafergwalls.
president trump: they weren'tactors.they didn't come from hollywood.this was an actual -- ithappened a few days ago.

&gt;&gt; they are hundreds andhundreds of miles away.that's not an invasion.

president trump: i think youshould let me run the countryand you run cnn.if you did it well be it wouldhelp your ratings.

&gt;&gt; i want to ask -- pardon me,ma'am.

president trump: that's enough.

&gt;&gt; one question on the russiainvestigation, are you concernedthat you may have to --

president trump: i'm notconcerned about anything with the russia investigation becauseit's a hoax.that's enough, are you, putcount mic.president trump: cnn should beashamed of itself having youworking for them.you are a rude, terrible personand you shouldn't be working forcnn.

jesse: before we get to thewhole arm push whether it was orwasn't.this is the president of theunited states web's thecommander-in-chief.he can characterize somethinghappening at our border howeverhe wants.invasion, incursion, intrusion.he has authority over the borderwhen it comes to nationalsecurity.barack obama in benghazi, he said that terrorist attack was aprotest over a video.now that was an extrememischaracterringization of thetruth.and the media never challenged him on that.they let him slide over that.for accosta couple and try to argue with the president in a rude and disrespectful way.just yanking the trespass issaying, jim, get a time out,cool off for a second and we'lllet you back next week.dinesh, what do you think?

&gt;&gt; the exchange to me was high lyenter takenning.it reminded me of some of thes kirmishes of reagan and samdonaldson from the old days.but reagan and sam donaldsonwere grownups.with jim acosta, i'm looking atan overgrown infant.when you are an emotionalinfant, you want to grabsomething, you don't want tostop, you want another piece ofcandy or cookie and you won'ttake no for an answer.you have a sense of entitlementand arrogance.

jesse: he thinks he's aboveeverybody else in that room.he thinks it's the jim acostashow.and he's thank to trade barbswith the president of the unitedstates.he thinks he's the rosa parks ofthe press corps.i don't know jim acosta.but his behavior is totally outof line.joe, taking a trespass awayisn't attacking the firstamendment.it's telling the guy, conductyourself with a little bit moredecorum.

&gt;&gt; i am glad you played theentire qulip.you watch the clip, he tries toask acosta four differentquestions.the way a press conference like this works, if you are a whitehouse correspondent.you get one question and maybe afollow-up.as you said, it's not his show.there are dozens of otherreporters in there, good one.they are not trying to ask fourquestions in this case.remember the way acosta startedthat.he says i want to challenge you,and then he goes into a lecture.this is the mid-40s version ofthe captain of the debate team.

jesse: the president took 68questions from 38 reporters.jim acosta wants to monopolizethe whole thing.if you want to ask a question,fine.if you have a follow up, see ifyou can squeeze it in.but to say to thecommander-in-chief, i'm runningthe press conference.you don't get to decide when youwant to move on to anotherreporter.i'm holding the mic and i get todecide when the president of theunited states moves on toanother reporter.

&gt;&gt; i think truck recognizes thatthis same press corps withacosta in the lead, perhaps waslap dog sycophantic to obama.to pretend they are not justobjective and quote doing theirjob when the transparent bias,the agenda is so obvious toanyone watching, that's whattrump find maddening.

jesse: i guess the white houseis being accused of altering ordoctoring that video?i don't know what they did ornot.if you look at tonightreal-time, he has the mic in theone hand and he holds his armdown on the woman's arm.

&gt;&gt; i don't think it many reallyeven the point.this is two years acosta doingthis.it's built to this crescendo.neil monroe was with the "dailycaller."he interrupted obama in 2012.i asked your producers to put together a couple headlines."politico," obama interrupted byheckling reporter.who is neil monroe and why is he it representing the president.obama heckler let him soundpassionate.that white house reporter wasn't

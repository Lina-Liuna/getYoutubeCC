3. do all of the necessary checks to makesure that it is safe to actually make your way into the parking spot you are going to 

3. continue moving forward until your side mirror lines up with the closest line of the parking spots so right now i'm gonna be making sure that my right side mirror lines up with the closest line to me on the parking spot there's a line that's closer to me andone that's further from me the closest line 

3. once you've lined up your mirror to that line you want to turn your steering wheel almost all the way to the direction of the parking spot you want to start advancing forward and then you want to slowly make your way into the parking spot

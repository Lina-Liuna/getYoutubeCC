有没有跟你说过，\n我已经跟你说过一千次了??

如果你不是去野营，\n我就把你给撂倒

在我们结婚后的头六周

整个七月，我一直给夏洛特各种不同的安眠药 ?

她很开心地吞下它们
..which she gobbled down happily.

她吃药很强
She was a great taker of pills.

我尝试的最后一种药把她放倒了四个小时
The last dose I had tried\nhad knocked her out for four hours.

但是并不足够能保证我晚上不被打扰
But that was not enough\nto guarantee me an undisturbed night.

汉

我想我肯定对这个东西对我不管用

确保

这头母牛睡得很死？

即使你在旁边乱动并转身？
Even if you were\ntossing and turning next to it.

那么 ?
Well...

你为什么不试试这个？

..try these?

最新的药
They're new.

我老婆吃了这药
My wife takes them and...

我整夜都没听到她吭一声

我回家了！

我们最终的目的地早被我抛到了脑后
In the back of my mind\nwas our eventual destination.

比尔兹利大学，是我最终开始我的教职的地方
Beardsley College, where I would finally\ntake up my teaching position.

但是目前对我来说，我需要继续前进，继续驾驶
But in the front of my mind was\nthe need to keep going, keep driving.

洛，这是我最后一次让你开这个车
Lo, that's the last time\nI let you drive this car.

在这个方框里面

打到界内，洛，试试看打倒界内

直到我的大脑

不管这一切，我简直是在天堂里
..despite all that, I was in paradise.

这个天堂的天空的颜色跟地狱之火一样
A paradise whose skies\nwere the color of hell flames,...

但它仍然是天堂
..but a paradise still.

我知道你已经接受了比尔兹利大学的教职
I know you have accepted a post\nat Beardsley College,...

而且我也知道，学业第一，学业最终而且学业永远重要
..and I know that there,\nacademics are first, last and always.

但是，那不是我们，希姆莱先生
Well, that's not us, Mr Himmler.

嗯 在比尔兹利预科学院
Uh... Here at Beardsley Prep,...

我们强调的是三个DS
..what we stress are the three Ds.

戏剧，舞会以及约会
Dramatics, dancing and dating.

现在，我知道教士在这一切背后监察，是吗？教士？
Now, I know that the Reverend Rigger is\nbehind us on this. Aren't you, Reverend?

你知道我一周的零花钱是一美元吧？

噢，夜晚的玫瑰夫人
Oh, rosy mistress of the night.

你让如此多的猎手心情激荡
You have enchanted\nmany a hunter's heart.

但是这次，我的迷人的夫人
But this time, my temptress,...

你遇见了你的对手
..you have met your match.

比猎手强了太多
For far more than a hunter,...

我

是个诗人

- 夜幕已经垂下，罗德明哥

打住！打住！莫娜
Hold it! Hold it! Mona...

等一会， 我要和多丽丝说两句话
Give us a moment.\nI'd like a word with Dolores.

当你说“欢笑的魔力” 的时候，对这些猎手使用魔力
When you say "your larking charms",\nuse your charms for the hunter.

因为是你巫婆
Because you're the witch.

你要把这些猎手带往你的巢穴
You're bringing the hunter to your lair.

-嗨，汉伯特先生\n- 你好，莫娜
- Hi, Mr Humbert.\n- Hello, Mona.

话剧，对吗？
Some play, huh?

你是女神，用你女神的魔力
You're nymphs.\nUse your nymph's charms.

引诱这些猎手

她是巫婆！她正在跳舞！

在风中跳舞！
In the wind!

她对我的求欢表现的越来越冷淡
As she grew cooler\ntowards my advances,...

我逐渐习惯给她买她想要的东西
..l became accustomed\nto purchasing her favors.

我从来不知道她把钱藏在哪里
Where she hid the money, I never knew.

停下来
Stop it!

我相信她正在攒钱好让她能够在经济上摆脱我
I was convinced she was storing it away\nin order to finance her escape from me.

你怎么能在做到一半的时候涨价！
You can't expect me to pay extra\nin the middle!

嗷！啊！
Ow! Argh!

她是个可爱的孩子，海兹先生
She's a lovely child, Mr Haze,...

但是她的初步性成熟好像给她带来了麻烦
..but the onset of sexual maturing\nseems to be giving her trouble.

- 这是你的观察，是吗？神父?\n- 是的，普拉特女士
- Isn't that your observation, Reverend?\n- To the tee, Miss Pratt.

-那么，你看，这是对一个14岁大的多丽丝的大致印象
So, you see, it is the general impression\nthat 14-year-old Dolores...

她病态地对性事缺乏兴趣
..is morbidly disinterested\nin sexual matters.

她有没有跟你说过这些事？

那么
Well...

那就是了
That's just it.

什么？
What's just it?

那 就是了
That's... just it.

她从没说过一句话
She hasn't said anything.

她从没说过一个词

嗯 但是谁能说呢？
Uh... But who has?

你 你是在说我
Are... Are you saying that I've...

没错
Exactly.

这是个非常严重的事

我们试着告诉你
What we're trying to say to you...

作为家庭的一员
..is that someone in the family,...

或许你  ?

对我来说难以启齿
This is very difficult for me.

好吧，这么说吧
Well, let me put it this way.

你们家庭的一员应该教导这个可爱的孩子 ?

人类繁衍的流程

抱歉

我去公园了，和莫娜在排练话剧

听着，洛，这一切必须停止
Look, Lo, this has got to stop.

我不知道你想干吗，但不管是什么
I don't know what you're up to,\nbut whatever it is,...

我要把你从比尔兹利送出去越快越好，除非这一切停止
..I'll yank you out of Beardsley as fast as\nI can pack a suitcase unless this stops!

除非什么停止？
Unless what stops?

- 你知道！\n- 慢点，先生！

你知道她说了什么 ?

一个小时之前曾密谋离开我的女孩子
..plotting her escape from me\nonly hours before?

说她想马上离开比尔兹利
She said she wanted\nto leave Beardsley then and there.

她想开始另外一场旅行
She wanted to take another trip,...

只是这次她将选择我们去哪里

我感激地封上了自己的命运

Hi. I'm Clare Quilty.

记住，有超过一百万吸烟者
Remember, over a million smokers...

我们现在应该是在
So we have to be in...

威斯呆一周
..Wace in exactly one week.

为什么在威斯呆一周？
But why Wace in a week?

因为我们应该看看那些神奇舞会开始时的庆祝舞蹈
Cos we gotta see the... ceremonial dances\nwhen they open the Magic Caves.

另外 准确的两周，另外4天之后
And... exactly two weeks\nand four days later,...

我们应该到达埃尔芬斯顿，看到了吗？
..we have to arrive in Elphinstone. See?

是的
Yes.

我们在那里爬红石山
That's where we climb the Red Rock.

我们应该准准确确地两周零四天之后爬这座山？
We have to climb this rock\nexactly two weeks and four days later?

没错
Exactly.

噢，我真是太兴奋了
Oh, I'm so excited.

我没法告诉你我哪天确定我们被跟踪的
I cannot tell you the exact day I first knew\nfor certain that we were being followed.

洛，打开手套柜拿一支笔一个笔记本
Lo, reach into the glove compartment\nand get the pad and pencil.

好了吗？现在开始写
Got it? Now write this down.

放进手套柜里，别吧口香糖弄到上面，会搞的
Put it in the glove box.\nDon't put gum on it cos it'll get...

你怎么把口香糖搞得到处都是？
Why have you got your gum everywhere?

把那个东西放进手套柜
Put that in the glove box.

后面有个警探跟着咱们
There's a detective following us.

他看起来很像我的叔叔古斯塔夫
He looks rather like my Uncle Gustave.

他很聪明，我们的追踪者
He was clever, our pursuer.

他一直在改变车子
He kept changing cars.

但是他的相貌对我来说真实得跟
But his presence was as real to me...

我自己的呼吸一样
..as my own breath.

后来他就突然不再出现了，我想知道他是不是已经知道了这一切
Then suddenly he would disappear\nand I'd wonder if i'd imagined everything.

洛！那个男人跟你说了什么？
Lo! What did that man say to you?

# Bags around your eyeballs\nwhich is red instead of white\n# Bags around your eyeballs\nwhich is red instead of white

- 他跟你说什么了？\n- 那个跟我说话的男人？
- What did he say to you?\n- The guy I was talking to?

- 是的，听着

快点告诉我他跟你说什么了

他问我有没有地图，他一定是把他的弄丢了
He asked me if I had a map.\nHe must've been lost.

# My heart's plumb gone
# My heart's plumb gone

# Cos you used temptation
# Cos you used temptation

# It'd be thrilling... if'n you're willing
# It'd be thrilling... if'n you're willing

听着，我已经告诉过你跟陌生人谈话的害处。你完全不知道
Look, I've told you about\ntalking to strangers. You've no idea...

洛，听我说
Lo, listen to me.

你很年轻，别人会占你便宜的
You're very young\nand people can take advantage of you.

难以想象
Very hard to imagine.

那个跟踪我们的男人是个条子
That man was the cop\nwho's been following us.

你必须告诉我他跟你说的每一个字
You have to tell me\nexactly what you told him.

如果他真是个条子，最糟糕的事就是让他知道我们吓坏了
If he really is a cop, the worst thing\nwe can do is let him know we're scared.

然后他就知道我们有罪
Then he'll know that we're guilty.

或者，你有罪
Or rather, that you're guilty.

Oh, no. She's just feeling a bit... um...

老天爷，洛！
My God, Lo!

你怎么不去睡觉？你呆在这也没用

她叔叔古斯塔夫来接她走，我们签字让她离开了
And when Uncle Gustave came for her,\nwe signed her out.

谁？ 谁？

他们说让你不用担心，他们会在爷爷家等你
They said to tell you not to worry,\nand they'll be at Grandpa's expecting you.

喂？

护士

谁把她带走了？有人把我女儿带走了
Who took her?\nSomebody took my daughter.

- 你应该跟一生说\n- 但是谁把她带走了？
- You need to talk to the doctor.\n- But who took her?

我女儿昨天晚上还在这儿
My daughter was in there last night.

- 谁把她带走了？\n- 嘿，放松，老兄
- Who took her away?\n- Hey, relax, pal!

别告诉我让我放松！我在找我女儿！医生！
Don't tell me to relax!\nI'm looking for my daughter! Doctor!

医生！医生！
Doctor! Doctor!

你对她做了什么？
What have you done with her?

她在哪儿?她在哪儿?
Where is she? Where is she?

她去哪儿了？哪儿？哪儿？哪儿？

你个该死的恶魔
You fucking fiends!

告诉我她在哪儿！

我只是在找我的女儿！

我想我只是有点 ?喝多了，对不起
I think I may just have...\nhad a little too much to drink. Sorry.

我很担心我女儿，你知道
I'm very worried\nabout my daughter, you see.

但是她跟古斯塔夫叔叔在一起
But she's with her Uncle Gustave.

她应该没事
So she'll be all right.

非常抱歉，请原谅我
I'm very sorry. Please forgive me.

她去她爷爷的农场了
She's gone to her... grandpa's farm.

她肯定没事
She'll be absolutely fine there.

哪里有比那更好的地方？
What better place for her?

我 我很好
I'm... I'm fine.

对不起
Please, I'm sorry.

对不起，，非常感谢
So sorry. Thank you very much.

对不起 对不起，
Sorry... Sorry.

非常抱歉
So sorry.

我找了所有我们去过的地方
I searched all our old haunts...

好几个月，那些痕迹依然温暖
..and for several months\nthe trail remained warm.

那个贼，绑架犯，无论你叫他什么
The thief, the kidnapper,\nwhatever you want to call him,...

他很聪明
..he was clever.

他肯定用的是假名
He would disguise his name.

但是我一直认识他的字迹
But I could always tell his handwriting.

嗯，先生！
Um... Sir!

他写的Ts, Ws, LS非常特别
He had very peculiar Ts, Ws and Ls.

你知道他的名字吗？
Do you know his name?

他看起来什么样？
What does he look like?

- 让我帮你\n- 不，请你
- Let me help.\n- No, please...

女士，抱歉，我正在找 ?
Ladies, I'm sorry. We're trying to find...

我想你们肯定很难理解
It must be hard\nfor you who already know who it was...

我的神经质
..to understand my mystification.

或者你们可能认为我有幻想症
Or maybe you think\nI was imagining things.

我女儿
..my daughter.

或许你们认为不可能有另外一个像我这样的人
Maybe you think it impossible that\nthere could have been another like me.

另外一个喜欢早熟少女的男人跟踪了我们整个丑陋的平原
Another mad lover of nymphets following\nus over the great and ugly plains.

那么，你是对的，当然
Well, you are right, of course.

没有一个人会像我一样
There was no-one else like me.

最终这些线索逐渐消失
Eventually the trail went cold and dead.

我最后回到了冰冷的，死气沉沉的比尔兹利
And I went back to cold, dead Beardsley.

“亲爱的爸爸，一切还好吗？”
"Dear Dad, how's everything?"

“我结婚了，我马上就要生孩子了”
"I'm married. I'm going to have a baby."

“我想应该是圣诞节前后”
"I guess it'll come\nright around Christmas."

“写这封信对我来说很艰难”
"This is a hard letter to write."

“我们很困难，因为我们没有足够的 ”
"I'm going nuts\nbecause we don't have enough...

来付账单并离开这里“
..to pay our debts and get out of here."

“迪克许诺会在阿拉斯加找个好工作”
"Dick has been promised\na big job in Alaska."

“你仍然对我很生气吗？”
"Are you still mad at me?"\n"Are you still mad at me?"

“请寄给我一张支票，我想三四百块钱就足够了 ”
"Please send us a cheque, Dad. We could\nmanage with three or four hundred,...

更少也可以，任何帮助都可以“
..or even less. Anything is welcome."

我已经受够了悲哀和困苦
"I have gone through\nmuch sadness and hardship."

“期待你的回复， 多丽”
"Yours expecting, Dolly."

“理查德，F 太太”
"Mrs Richard F...

“席勒”
..Schiller."

嗯
Well!

请进
Come in.

你，莫利，呆在外面
You, Molly, stay out.

好女孩
Good girl.

老公在家？
Husband at home?

嗯
Yeah.

你想坐哪儿？摇椅还是沙发？
Where do you wanna sit?\nThe rocker or the divan?

过来跟我一起坐在沙发上吧
Come sit with me on the divan.

就是他？
Is that him?

梯子上的那个？
Up the ladder?

你想让我叫他进来吗？
You want me to call him in?

不用了
No.

他不是我找的那个人
He's not the one I want.

他不是什么?
He's not the what?

你知道我指的是什么
You know what I mean.

他在哪儿？
Where is he?

听着 ?
Look...

迪克跟整件事没有关系，他以为你是我父亲
Dick has nothing to do with all that stuff.\nHe thinks you're my father.

请不要把事情搞那么复杂
Please don't bring up all that muck.

- 好吧，我自己会搞清楚\n- 你真不知道？
- All right, I'll find out myself.\n- You really don't know?

老天爷，爸爸，是奎尔第
My God, Dad, it was Quilty.

是克莱尔 奎尔第
It was Clare Quilty.

对，
Yes.

是的，当然是他
Yes, of course.

奎尔第
Quilty.

是的
Yeah.\nYeah.

他是唯一的一个让我疯狂的男人
He was the only man\nI was ever really crazy about.

那我呢？
What about me?

他带你去哪儿了？
Where did he take you?

快点告诉我
Just tell me.

好吧，每个人都知道他喜欢小姑娘
Well, everybody knew he liked little girls.

他曾经在他在帕金顿的豪宅里把她们拍下来
He used to film them in his mansion\nover in Parkington, Pavor Manor.

但是我没有干那些事情
But I wasn't gonna do all those things.

什么事？
All what things?

两个男孩两个女孩或者
Two girls and two boys or...

我不清楚，大概三四个男人
..l don't know, three or four men.

另外， vivian 把整个过程拍下来
And Vivian was filming the whole thing.

我说“不，我才不会给这些禽兽男人们吹箫”
I said "No, I'm not gonna blow\nall those beastly boys."

“我想跟你”
"I want you."

所以她把我除外了
So he threw me out.

我看着她，看了又看
I looked and looked at her...

我知道，就像我知道我必死无疑那样清楚
..and I knew,\nas clearly as I know that I will die,...

我是如此的爱她，胜过我所看到的所能想象到的地球上的任何事物
..that I loved her more than anything\nI'd ever seen or imagined on earth.

她以前是一个妖女，现在却像一片枯叶，
She was only the dead leaf echo\nof the nymphet from long ago...

但是我爱她，这个洛丽塔
..but I loved her, this Lolita,...

苍白、臃肿、混俗，怀着别的男人的孩子
..pale and polluted\nand big with another man's child.

她可以褪色，可以枯萎， 我不在乎
She could fade and wither - I didn't care.

但我只要看她一眼
I would still go mad with tenderness...

万般柔情，涌上心头
..at the mere sight other face.

洛丽塔
Lolita...

从这里到那个你熟悉的汽车
From here to that old car\nthat you know so well...

只有25步的距离
..is a stretch of 25 paces.

走过这25步
Make those 25 steps...

跟我在一起吧
..with me, now.

你是说如果我跟你一起去汽车旅馆你就会给我点钱？
You're saying you'll give us some money\nif I go to a motel with you?

不是 不是！！
No... No!

我是说你离开这里和我一起生活，一起死去，和我一起干任何事
I'm saying leave here and come live\nwith me, die with me, everything with me.

你简直是疯了
You're crazy.

如果你拒绝。你仍然能拿到这些钱
If you refuse, you still get the money.

- 真的？\n- 是的
- Really?\n- Yeah.

拿着，拿着吧
There. Have it.

哦，老天爷
Oh my God.

你给了我四千美元？
You're giving us four thousand bucks?

- 谢谢\n- 不要
- Thank you...\n- No...

不要碰我
Don't touch me.

你一碰我我就会死
I'll die if you touch me.

我只想告诉你\n你有机会跟我一起走
Just tell me...\nthere's a chance you'll come with me.

不，亲爱的
No, honey.

我宁愿跟克莱尔走
I'd almost rather go back with Clare.

噢
Oh...

好了，我走了
I'll go now.

- 我让迪克回来跟你告别？\n- 不用了，我根本不想见他
- Can I call Dick in to say goodbye?\n- No. I don't want to see him, at all.

我只想走
I just want to go.

洛，你能不能忘记我对你做过的事情？
Lo, can you ever forget\nwhat I've done to you?

说再见，莫利
Say goodbye, Molly.

跟爸爸说再见
Say goodbye to my dad.

迪克！你猜有什么好消息！
Dick! Guess what!

陪审团的先生女士们
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,...

我必须说我对在煤山那次告别以前所作的事感到后悔
..l have to say that I regret all I did\nbefore that last goodbye in Coalmont.

但我从来不对后来发生的事后悔
But I regret nothing of what came after.

哦，你是谁？
Now, who are you?

你是，是不是布鲁斯特？
Are you, by any chance, Brewster?

你知道不，你看起来不像杰克 布鲁斯特
You know, you don't look\nlike Jack Brewster.

我是说，神似并不让人感到意外
I mean, the resemblance\nis not particularly striking.

有人说他有个兄弟有一个同样的电话公司
Somebody told me he had a brother\nwith the same phone company.

我不是什么布鲁斯特兄弟
I'm neither of the Brewsters.

到路边停下
Pull over!

到路边停下
Pull over!

你记不记得有个小女孩名字叫
Do you recall a little girl named...

多丽丝 海兹？
..Dolores Haze?

你晓得不，我是她父亲
You see, I'm her father.

瞎扯
Nonsense.

你是外国人，你是外国势力的特工
You're a foreigner.\nYou're an agent of a foreign power.

你是个外国文化特工
You're a foreign literary agent.

她是我女儿
She was my daughter.

她是我孩子

哦，你知道，我喜欢孩子们
Oh, you know, I adore children myself.

也喜欢他们的父亲
And fathers...

我喜欢父亲
I love fathers.

啊
Ah...

坐下！
Sit down!

哦，找到了
Oh. There they are.

现在我需要一些火柴，借个火？
Now we need matches. You got a light?

奎尔第，你给我集中精神
Quilty, I want you to concentrate.

你马上就要死
You're about to die.

喔
Ooh.

耶稣
Jesus!

你想站着死还是坐着死？
Do you want to be executed\nstanding up or sitting down?

让我想想，让我想想，这是个很难回答的问题
Just let me think, let me think.\nIt's not an easy question.

我只想知道发生了什么事
Try to understand what is happening.

我 我 我??我
I- l-l-l...

- 记得多丽丝 海兹？\n- 我愿意
- Remember Dolores Haze.\n- I'm willing...

我愿意试试，我， 只是
I'm willing to try. I am. Just...

好吧，听着
OK. Listen.

我犯了个错误，我很后悔
I made a mistake, which I regret,...

真的
..sincerely.

我跟多丽之间什么都没发生，实际上，我性无能
I couldn't have any fun with your Dolly.\nI'm practically impotent is the sad truth.

但是她有个很棒的假期，见到了很多不错的人，嘿，你知道吧-
But she had a swell vacation, met some\nremarkable people. Hey, do you know -

站好别动！
Stay still!

噢，老天爷
Oh, God...

你骗了我
You cheated me.

你欺骗了我的救赎
You cheated me of my redemption.

- 你必须得死\n- 我不知道你在说什么
- You have to die.\n- I don't know what you're talking about.

我的大脑和舌头今天有点不听使唤
My memory and my eloquence\nare not at their best today.

但是真的，你必须承认你从来不是一个理想的继父
But really, you have to admit\nyou were never an ideal stepfather.

嗯？
Hm?

我没有强迫你的女儿加入我们
I did not force your protégée to join me.

是她让我把她带到一个快乐的家中
It was she who made me\nremove her to a happier home.

看看你四周，看到了吗？
Look around you. See?

你看到这座房子了？
You see this house?

夏天很凉快，很舒服，我建议你搬进来，嗯？
It's very cool in the summer. Comfortable.\nI suggest that you move in, hm?

我想你住在这里一定很开心
I think you'll be happy here.

你可以用我的衣柜
You can use my wardrobe.
